## What Is This?

BareDroidNX is a **compatibility / translation layer** that lets Android native (NDK) games run directly on the Nintendo Switch's **Horizon OS** — the Switch's real operating system.

**This is NOT Android running on the Switch.** There is no Android OS, no emulator, no virtual machine. The game's ARM64 machine code runs directly on the Switch's Tegra X1 processor, the same chip Android phones use. A thin shim layer fakes just enough of the Android runtime (libc, OpenGL ES, JNI, asset management) that the game's native `.so` library doesn't notice it isn't on Android.

Think of it like Wine on Linux — not emulation, but translation.

### Current Focus

We are currently only attempting **simple, old, 2D Android games** — specifically games that:

- Ship an `arm64-v8a` native library (`.so` file)
- Use OpenGL ES 2.0 or 3.0 for rendering
- Have **no** Google Play Services dependency
- Save locally (no cloud saves required)
- **Do not require network/online connectivity**

We are **not** planning support for online-only games (such as Roblox, Fortnite, etc.) anytime soon — if ever. The project is focused on proving that even the simplest games can run, which is still a significant technical challenge.

Our test target is **Hill Climb Racing 1.x** by Fingersoft — a simple 2D physics game with no online requirement, widely used in compatibility testing.

### What We've Achieved So Far

- The NRO launches from hbmenu and shows a working APK browser UI
- The Switch correctly **extracts the APK** — unpacking the game's native libraries and assets from the `.apk` file onto the SD card. This works reliably.
- The Switch loads and parses the ELF binary (`libgame.so`) and attempts to link it against our shim table
- The on-screen progress display shows each launch stage in real time
- **Docked mode is detected** — the footer warns you when launched in docked mode, since games require touch screen input (handheld only)
- The launcher **no longer crashes the Switch** when `svcSetMemoryPermission` fails — instead it shows a clear diagnostic screen explaining the blocker
- Full diagnostic output is written to `sdmc:/BareDroidNX/compat_log.txt`

The game does not yet run — there are outstanding blockers (see [Current Blockers](#current-blockers)) — but the groundwork is there.

## Controls

> **Handheld mode only.** Android games use touch screen input. The Switch touchscreen only works in handheld mode — in docked mode there is no touch input, so games will be uncontrollable. BareDroidNX now detects docked mode and shows a warning in the footer.

**BareDroidNX launcher controls (in the APK browser):**

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| D-pad / Left stick | Navigate APK list |
| **A** | Launch selected APK |
| **Y** | Rescan APK folder |
| **+** | Quit |
| **B** | Back (on result screen) |

---

## Setup

1. Copy `BareDroidNX.nro` to `sdmc:/switch/`
2. Place `.apk` files in `sdmc:/BareDroidNX/apks/`
3. Launch from hbmenu (Atmosphere CFW required)
4. Navigate with D-pad or left stick, press **A** to launch
5. If a launch fails, check `sdmc:/BareDroidNX/compat_log.txt` for the full error log

---

## Building

Requires [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/) with `devkitA64` and `libnx` installed.

```sh
export DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitpro
make
```

Output: `BareDroidNX.nro`

### Dependencies (via pacman/devkitPro)

```
switch-sdl2 switch-sdl2_image switch-sdl2_ttf
switch-libpng switch-libjpeg-turbo switch-minizip
switch-mesa switch-glad
```

## Current Blockers

These are the known issues preventing Hill Climb Racing from running:

### 1. ~~Code pages not executable~~ — **RESOLVED**

The ELF loader now uses libnx's `jitCreate` / `jitTransitionToExecutable` API instead of `memalign` + `svcSetMemoryPermission`. This creates a dual-view mapping (writable side for loading, executable side for running) that the Switch kernel allows. The old `0xD801` error no longer occurs.

### 2. ~~Many unresolved symbols~~ — **RESOLVED (120+ symbols shimmed)**

All symbols that appeared in the Hill Climb Racing compat log are now shimmed:

- `setjmp` / `longjmp` — forwarded to newlib
- `sem_init`, `sem_wait`, `sem_post`, `sem_destroy` — single-threaded stubs
- `clock_gettime`, `nanosleep`, `gettimeofday`, `gmtime`, `localtime`, `mktime`, `strftime` — newlib passthrough
- All wide char/locale functions (`wcslen`, `wmemcpy`, `iswupper`, `setlocale`, `newlocale`, etc.)
- Bionic fortified wrappers (`__strlen_chk`, `__memcpy_chk`, `__strcat_chk`, etc.)
- Networking: `socket`, `connect`, `recv`, `send`, etc. — all stub returning `ENOTSUP`
- `pthread_mutexattr_init/destroy/settype`, `sched_yield`, `syscall`, `getcwd`
- `android_set_abort_message`, `dl_iterate_phdr`, `sincosf`, `__sF`, `__stack_chk_guard`
- `strtoll_l`, `strtoull_l`, `strtold_l`, `vasprintf`, `stpcpy`, `strerror`, `vsscanf`

### 3. Background threads not supported

`pthread_create` is stubbed to return a fake handle and never actually spawn a thread. Games that rely on a separate render or physics thread will appear frozen or crash.

### 4. Game may crash at runtime

Even with all symbols resolved and code executable, the game could crash during initialisation (NULL deref, bad GLES call, unimplemented JNI method, etc.). The next step is to get a crash address from the compat log and identify which code path is failing.

## TODO / Roadmap

> Items are roughly ordered by priority. "Phase 0" is the current work.

### Phase 0 — Make any game do *something* (in progress)

- [x] APK browser UI with icon extraction
- [x] APK extraction (libs + assets) onto SD card
- [x] Custom ARM64 ELF loader with RELA relocation
- [x] JNI environment shim (fake JavaVM / JNIEnv)
- [x] EGL setup (GLES 2 + 3 shim table passthrough)
- [x] On-screen progress display during launch stages
- [x] Full diagnostic result screen with error details
- [x] Docked mode detection — footer warns when not in handheld mode
- [x] Early abort when code pages are not executable — shows diagnostic screen instead of crashing Switch
- [x] **Fix code-page permissions** — ELF loader now uses libnx `jitCreate` / `jitTransitionToExecutable` for dual-view RW+Rx mapping
- [x] All 120+ unresolved symbols shimmed — `sem_*`, `clock_gettime`, `nanosleep`, `gettimeofday`, wide-char, locale, Bionic fortified wrappers, networking stubs, `android_set_abort_message`, `sincosf`, `setjmp`/`longjmp`, `__sF`, `__stack_chk_guard`
- [x] **Per-constructor logging** — each of the 417 `DT_INIT_ARRAY` constructors is logged (address + index) with an immediate flush before it's called, so the crash site shows in `compat_log.txt` when the Switch dies mid-constructor
- [x] **Load all .so files** — all three libs loaded smallest-first so cross-library symbols are available before any constructors run
- [x] **40+ new shims** — signal handling (`sigaction`, `sigemptyset/fill/add/del`, `pthread_sigmask`), thread naming (`pthread_setname_np`, `prctl`), process info (`gettid`, `getpid`, `getauxval`), memory (`mprotect`, `mmap/munmap`), barriers, `sleep`/`usleep`, `strtod_l`/`strtof_l`, `access`, `lstat`, `chmod`, `ioctl`, `pipe`, `dup/dup2`, `raise`, `kill`, `pthread_kill`, `__register_atfork`, `clock_nanosleep`
- [ ] **Identify constructor crash** — need a new compat_log run; the last logged constructor before the crash is the culprit
- [ ] Investigate and fix whatever the failing constructor is doing
- [ ] Real touch input delivery via `AInputQueue` / `ALooper`

### Phase 1 — Touch input

- [ ] Map Switch touchscreen events to `AInputQueue` touch events delivered to the game
- [x] Docked-mode detection — footer shows warning when not in handheld mode
- [ ] Block launch in docked mode with a hard block + clear message ("Controls only work in handheld mode — the game requires touch input")

### Phase 2 — Stability

- [ ] Real `pthread` support using libnx `Thread` (for games with background render/physics threads)
- [x] Load all `.so` files in dependency order (smallest-first) — was previously only loading the largest
- [ ] Implement `dl_iterate_phdr` so stack unwinders work
- [ ] Save/load state via proper `internalDataPath` on the SD card
- [ ] Catch and display fatal signal info on crash instead of hard-locking

### Phase 3 — Polish

- [ ] Add NRO icon (author: aaronworld.uk)
- [ ] Version bump system — each build increments `APP_VERSION`
- [ ] Per-APK settings overlay (resolution, framerate cap)
- [ ] APK delete / manage from the UI

### Not Planned (for now)

- Online / multiplayer games (Roblox, Fortnite, etc.)
- Google Play Services (GMS) stub
- ARM32 (`armeabi-v7a`) game support — Switch is 64-bit only

## Changelog / Change Checklist

> This section is updated with every significant change. Most recent first.

### [Unreleased / Current Build]

- [x] **Per-constructor logging** — `elfRunCtors()` logs each constructor address + index and flushes to `compat_log.txt` before calling it; the last logged entry before a Switch crash pinpoints the culprit
- [x] **Load all .so files** — replaced `findMainSo` with `findAllSos`; all three libs are loaded smallest-first so cross-library symbol resolution works before any constructors run
- [x] **40+ new shims** — `sigaction`, `sigemptyset`, `sigfillset`, `sigaddset`, `sigdelset`, `sigismember`, `pthread_sigmask`, `sigprocmask`, `prctl`, `gettid`, `getpid`, `getuid`, `getgid`, `getauxval`, `mprotect`, `mmap`, `munmap`, `pipe`, `dup`, `dup2`, `ioctl`, `access`, `chmod`, `fchmod`, `lstat`, `pthread_setname_np`, `pthread_getname_np`, `pthread_attr_setstack`, `pthread_barrier_*`, `kill`, `raise`, `pthread_kill`, `sleep`, `usleep`, `clock_nanosleep`, `strtod_l`, `strtof_l`, `__register_atfork`
- [x] **ELF loader: replace `memalign` + `svcSetMemoryPermission` with libnx JIT API** — `jitCreate` / `jitTransitionToWritable` / `jitTransitionToExecutable` give a dual-view RW+Rx mapping; the 0xD801 blocker is resolved
- [x] **JIT dual-mapping**: relocations are written to the writable (`rw_addr`) side; GOT entries store exec (`rx_addr`) addresses; symtab/strtab are copied to heap before the JIT transition unmaps the write side
- [x] **120+ new shims**: `setjmp`/`longjmp`, `sem_*`, all time functions, all wide-char and locale functions, all Bionic fortified string wrappers, networking stubs (return `ENOTSUP`), `sched_yield`, `syscall`, `sysconf`, `getcwd`, `dl_iterate_phdr`, `android_set_abort_message`, `sincosf`, `stpcpy`, `vasprintf`, `vsscanf`, `strerror`, `strtold`, `puts`/`putchar`, `rename`/`remove`, `__sF` data stub, `__stack_chk_guard` address, `pthread_mutexattr_*`, `__cxa_finalize`
- [x] Capture `svcSetMemoryPermission` result code from ELF loader and surface it on the diagnostic screen
- [x] Abort launch early when code pages are not executable — shows diagnostic screen instead of hard-crashing the Switch
- [x] Add "Checking code permissions" progress step so the user sees where the launch stopped
- [x] Docked mode detection — footer turns amber and warns that games need handheld (touch screen) mode
- [x] Add `LaunchResult` struct — `launchApk()` now returns structured error info instead of a bare bool
- [x] Add `ProgressCb` callback — UI shows each launch stage on-screen in real time
- [x] Replace "(loader not yet implemented)" stub screen with a proper diagnostic result screen showing failure stage, unresolved symbol count, and svc error codes
- [x] Track and display unresolved ELF symbol count after each load
- [x] Change NRO author to `aaronworld.uk`
- [x] Improve README with badges, profile link, AI disclaimer, in-depth TODO

### 0.1.0 — Initial release

- [x] APK browser UI (SDL2, 1280×720)
- [x] APK icon + metadata extraction (AndroidManifest.xml + resources.arsc parser)
- [x] Full APK extraction to SD card (libs + assets)
- [x] Custom ARM64 ELF loader with RELA relocation processing
- [x] JNI / JavaVM fake environment
- [x] GLES 2 + GLES 3 shim table (400+ functions)
- [x] EGL setup via switch-mesa
- [x] SD card logging (`log.txt` + `compat_log.txt`)

## About

Made by [Aaron](https://aaronworld.uk) — a non-developer who wanted to see Android games on their modded Switch, and is figuring it out one step at a time with the help of Claude AI.

> **~99.8% of all code in this repo was written by [Claude](https://anthropic.com) (claude-sonnet-4-6 model).** I describe the problem, test on real hardware, and point out what's broken. Claude writes the fixes. This is an honest experiment in AI-assisted hardware hacking.

If this interests you, star the repo and check back. Progress will be slow but real.
